Ah, that explains everything!

If the vector database (the "Brain" of the Law App) **only** contains Consumer Protection laws (FCRA, FDCPA, Lemon Laws), then when you search for "Dog Bite," the vector search is finding the *closest mathematical neighbor*, which happens to be FCRA (likely due to keywords like "damages" or "report").

Since the Law App has no knowledge of "Personal Injury Law" (Torts), it correctly flags these cases as **INELIGIBLE** because they don't match the laws it knows. It's actually working perfectly—it's saying "This isn't a Consumer Protection case."

To fix the demo, we should use forms that match the **Consumer Protection** domain you have indexed.

Here are **10 Consumer Protection Forms** that will actually trigger "Likely Violation" verdicts with your current database:
